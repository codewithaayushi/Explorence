		In the year 1941, ATPI, the Association of Principals of Technical institutions, was initiated. In 1967, the ATPI saw its conversion to ISTE or Indian Society for Technical Education. This conversion was intended to expand its activities in order to advance the cause of technological education.<br>

The ISTE aims to spread awareness among its members in addition, to making them realise their role and responsibility regarding technical education for the service of humanity and the advancement of general welfare.<br>

<b>Aims of ISTE</b><br>
Putting technology to use for enabling educators and education leaders who are engaged in advancing excellence in learning and teaching with the use of technology is what the ISTE, which is the premier membership association, aims at. When it comes to a trusted source for professional development, knowledge generation, advocacy and leadership for innovation, ISTE is a known name.<br>

For enabling the cause of technical education and research, ISTE is a reputed society as it cooperates with Central and State Governments industry and approved institutions, professional bodies, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Department of Science and Technology (DST) and individuals in the field.<br>
