		<p>
		The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)—founded in 1880—is a not-for-profit professional organization that enables collaboration, knowledge sharing and skill development across all engineering disciplines, while promoting the vital role of the engineers in society. The ASME—Chitkara Students Section (one of the 500 Students Sections across many institutes around the globe) has been active on our campus since 15 January, 2010.<br><br>
		
		The Society receives members from various colleges and universities, and acts as a platform where students and professionals can congregate and endeavour towards a common goal of creating the importance of engineers in the society. They also receive a great opportunity to interact—at local as well as international level—with people in same profession and of like-minded interests.

At ASME, the community of engineers worldwide finds support to tackle, and design solutions to, real-world challenges. The ASME codes and standards, publications, conferences, continuing education and professional development programs provide a foundation for advancing technical knowledge and a safer world.
